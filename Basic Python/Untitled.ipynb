    "## What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Python is popular programming language.it was created by Guido van Rossum, and relesed in 1991.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "* web development (server-side)\n",
    "* Software development\n",
    "* Mathematics\n",
    "* System scripting\n",

    "## What can Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Python can be used on server to create web applications.\n",
    "   * Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "   * Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "   * Python can be used to handle big Data and perform Complex mathematics.\n",
    "   * Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "   * Python works on different platforms (windows,Mac,Linux,Rasberry pi,etc).\n",
    "   * Python has a simple syntax similar to the English Language.\n",
    "   * Python runs an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "   * Python can be treated a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Syntax compared to other Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "   * Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "   * Python relies on identation,using whitespace,to define scope; such as the scope of loops,functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose."
